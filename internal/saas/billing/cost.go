// Package billing is the single source of truth for translating an
// upstream-side (official) cost into the dollar amount that gets deducted
// from a token's wallet and recorded in the request log.
//
// Formula:
//
//	billed = official * multiplier
//
// `multiplier` is the per-(group × provider) coefficient stored on the
// pricing_groups table (claude_multiplier / codex_multiplier). Operator
// edits it from the admin panel; defaults are claude=0.05 (1/20) and
// codex=0.02 (1/50). A non-positive multiplier falls back to 1.0 so
// callers don't need to special-case missing config.
