// Codex WebSocket EGRESS: forwarding an ordinary HTTP request over an upstream
// WebSocket instead of the legacy HTTP POST /codex/responses.
//
// This is the opposite direction from codex_ws.go, which accepts a WebSocket
// from a client that already speaks the protocol. Almost no client does — the
// traffic is HTTP — so the ingress route reaches very little of the fleet. This
// file is what lets the majority of requests use the transport a current
// codex-tui actually uses.
//
// # Why bother
//
//  1. A WebSocket carries protocol-level ping/pong, so it survives the
//     multi-second silences (reasoning -> answer, tool thinking) that truncate
//     an idle HTTP SSE stream. Those truncations are what clients report as
//     "stream disconnected before completion".
//  2. Real codex-tui 0.135+ streams turns over the WebSocket. The HTTP POST
//     route is the LEGACY one. Presenting a current client's User-Agent,
//     version header and beta list while using the old transport is a
//     one-comparison difference from every genuine client.
//
// # Why it is cheap to add
//
// Both transports carry the same events; only the envelope differs. cc-core's
// codexws.SSEStream re-adds the `event:`/`data:` lines, so the entire response
// pipeline below this file — line reader, shed withholding, usage extraction,
// keepalive relay, the chat-completions bridge, and the non-streaming
// aggregator — consumes a WebSocket turn unchanged. Nothing downstream knows
// which transport served it.
//
// # Why it is safe to enable
//
// Every failure mode lands before the first byte reaches the client, which is
// the same window the credential failover already owns. A dial that fails, a
// pooled socket the server closed, a turn that breaks before output: all of
// them fall back to the HTTP path within the SAME attempt, so the caller sees
// latency and nothing else. Past the first byte there is no fallback, and none
// is attempted — that case is reported exactly as an HTTP stream break is.

// codexWSEgress owns the upstream WebSocket pool and the per-credential
// cooldown that keeps a refusing backend from costing every request a failed
// dial.
