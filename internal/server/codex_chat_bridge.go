// codex_chat_bridge.go is the transport half of the /v1/chat/completions bridge
// for Codex OAuth credentials. The protocol translation itself lives in
// cc-core's apicompat package, shared with HypiToken. Request preparation lives
// in cc-core/codexoauth; only the gin/SSE plumbing stays here.

// streamCodexAsChatCompletions relays the backend's Responses SSE stream to the
// client as a chat.completion.chunk stream. Keepalive, write serialization,
// lazy commit and terminal tracking come from the same cc-core relay the native
// /v1/responses passthrough uses, so a bridged stream behaves identically under
// a slow upstream or an intermediary idle timeout.
//
// Takes an io.Reader rather than the *http.Response so both bridge callers can
// use it: the OAuth path hands over resp.Body directly, while the API-key path
// has already wrapped the body in a bufio.Reader to sniff SSE-vs-JSON
// (responseIsSSE peeks) and must pass that reader in — reading resp.Body afresh
// would drop whatever the sniff already buffered.
//
// commit is invoked once, immediately before the first byte reaches the client.
// Committing lazily is what lets a pre-output shed be withheld and failed over,
// exactly as on the native path; pass a closure that writes the SSE headers.
//
// Retryable failures before output stay invisible so the caller can fail over.
// After output starts, the shared converter emits an error envelope and [DONE].
