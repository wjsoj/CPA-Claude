// forward loop for another credential, and which are handed to the caller.

// 401/402/403 are retryable on this path even though they are the credential's
// own answer — on a relay, another key may well work, and the rejected key
// needs to leave rotation rather than be re-presented on the next request.

// Regression for the dead-relay 502 incident: a Codex API-key relay returning
// 5xx must eventually stop being selected.
//
// This used to be enforced by having reportCodexAPIKeyFault apply a fixed 45s
// *quota* cooldown, because MarkFailure alone could not downgrade an API key
// and the quota flag was the only lever IsHealthy honoured. cc-core's circuit
// breaker replaced that workaround, so the assertion moves with it: the relay
// is paused after a run of failures (not on the first, so a one-off 502 no
// longer sidelines a working key), the pause reports as a quarantine rather
// than as a misleading "quota exceeded", and it expires on its own.
